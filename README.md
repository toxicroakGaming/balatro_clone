# balatro_clone
THIS PROJECT IS UNDER RENNOVATION. A NEW VERSION WILL BE UPLOADED ONCE THE PLANNING IS DONE
planning can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g5RIur4inbFQZe3a8zv47m9lrEESHvLJqN0-u6QI3ZI/edit?usp=sharing

It will start through the terminal and move up towards visual approaches. 
There will be a website associated with the project as well.

I am not affiliated with the original creator of Balatro nor do I
claim to be. This is just for fun and is not being sold for money
or being used for mass production. Primarily, it is to practice
and show my programming skills for future reference and internships/jobs
