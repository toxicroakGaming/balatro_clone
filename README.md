# balatro_clone
This is gonna be a clone of balatro. more terminal based in starting updates, but might update to have a GUI later on

This is development process:

Get the main card logic working (this is where this stands)

get jokers to interact with cards

get the effects wokring on both jokers and cards

add in packs to add cards

tarots

planets

vouchers

blind health and skip effects

boss blinds

I am not affiliated with the original creator of Balatro nor do I
claim to be. This is just for fun and is not being sold for money
or being used for mass production. Primarily, it is to practice
and show my programming skills for future reference and internships/jobs

This is what the current update of this game has:
it creates a deck with 52 cards and then creates 3 hands from said deck
does not choose from remaining cards in deck (in other words, all hands
come from a 52 card deck, not a (52 - (sizeof(hand) * num hands)) deck)
